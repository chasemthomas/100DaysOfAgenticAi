That's a useful feature to have.\n\nA couple of thoughts if you're interested:\n\n- **Testing edge cases** - Beyond simple name recall, you might want to test things like whether it correctly handles contradictions (if you said your name was something else later), multi-turn references, or contextual information that requires understanding, not just pattern matching.\n\n- **Privacy consideration** - If this is storing user data, you'll want to think about data retention policies, encryption, and user control over their information.\n\n- **Scope limits** - It's worth clarifying what should be remembered (this conversation only? across sessions?) and what shouldn't be (sensitive info, etc.).\n\nHow's the development going? What stack are you using for the history storage?"
